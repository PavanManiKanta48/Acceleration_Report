-----Net Overview------
 -.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
 -With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and more.

Languages :
 -C#,F#,VB.

.NET Framework :
  -It is the original implementation of .NET. It supports running websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows.
Xamarin/Mono :
  -Xamarin.Forms is an open source cross-platform UI framework from Microsoft for building iOS, Android, and Windows apps with
  .NET from a single, shared codebase.

Q. What can i build with .net?
 -web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and more.

Q. Who Build .net
 -Microsoft.

Libraries :
 -To extend functionality, Microsoft and others maintain a healthy .NET package ecosystem.
 -NuGet : is a package manager built specifically for .NET that contains over 100,000 packages.
 - Libraries are in .Dll format we can call these libraries in other applications.
CLR :
 -Handle running apps and manages other system services(garbage collections, & security & exception Handling)

----Net --------
 1.Net FrameWork 
 2.Net Core

Q. What is .NET Framework?
 -.NET Framework is a managed execution environment for Windows that provides a variety of services to its running apps.
  It consists of two major components: 
 1.the common language runtime (CLR), which is the execution engine that handles running apps.
 2. .NET Framework Class Library, which provides a library of tested, reusable code that developers can call from their own apps.
 
Dot Net Framework Main Objectives:
 -Supports platform independent concepts
 -Supports language independent concepts
 -Supports language interoperability concepts
 -Supports pure OOPs concepts
 -Supports to work with databases with the help of ADO.NET
 -Supports to develop game programming with the help of multi-threading

Tools to develop Certain type Of Apps:
 -Languages : 
    -Webforms : Used to design form based applications Windows.
    -Asp.Net  :For Model basedd Apps.
    -ADO.Net  :For Web Apps that provides Consistent Access To Data base.

------------------------------.Net Web Project Structures -----------------
Net Web Project Structures :
 -ASP.NET is a free web framework for building great websites and web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 -ASP.NET offers three frameworks for creating web applications: Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC, and ASP.NET Web Pages. All three frameworks
  are stable and mature, and you can create great web applications with any of them.

Advantages of a Web Forms-Based Web Application :
 -It supports an event model that preserves state over HTTP, which benefits line-of-business Web application development. 
 -It uses view state or server-based forms, which can make managing state information easier.
 -It works well for small teams of Web developers and designers who want to take advantage of the large number of components
  available for rapid application development.

ASP.NET Web Forms :
-----------------
 -You can build dynamic websites using a familiar drag-and-drop, event-driven model. A design surface and hundreds
  of controls and components let you rapidly build sophisticated, powerful UI-driven sites with data access.
 -How To Create a Web Form in Visual Studio :
  1. Got to Vs.
  2. Click on Create a new project.
  3. Select Asp.net web application .net Frameworkand click on create.
  4.select Empty template and check the webform checkbox or u can select webform template to create a webform application.
-Runat Server : which is required for every server control.
-On Click Event : when u create this even in .aspcx file it will create a method for that event in code behind.
-Responce.Redirect("~/ ")
-Asp.net webforms are event driven pages with server code, server events and server controls.
-this uses master template which are a centralized file where you can
 
MVC :
-----
 -ASP.NET MVC gives you a powerful, patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and that gives
 you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development. ASP.NET MVC includes many features that enable fast, TDD-friendly development
 for creating sophisticated applications that use the latest web standards.
Q.What is mvc pattern ?
  -Mvc Application is divided into 3 major components.
  1.Model
  2.View
  3.Controller

Q.What is asp.Net Core Mvc ?
  -it is a light weight, open source and highly tesstable presentation framework.

Q.Functionalities in Mvc?
  -

Routing :
 -ASP.NET Core MVC is built on top of ASP.NET Core's routing, a powerful URL-mapping component that lets you build applications that have 
  comprehensible and searchable URLs.
Eg: 
  routes.MapRoute(name: "Default", template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

Model binding :
 -ASP.NET Core MVC model binding converts client request data (form values, route data, query string parameters, HTTP headers)
  into objects that the controller can handle.

-The principles behind developing mvc ix seperation of Concerns.
-seperation ensures that the business model is simplle to test.
-Using the MVC pattern Controller select the view to be displayed to the user and supplies it with any model data it reqires
  
Advantages of an MVC-Based Web Application :
 -It makes it easier to manage complexity by dividing an application into the model, the view, and the controller.
 -It does not use view state or server-based forms. This makes the MVC framework ideal for developers who want full control over the 
  behavior of an application.
 -t works well for Web applications that are supported by large teams of developers and Web designers who need a high degree of control
  over the application behavior.

ASP.NET Web Pages :
------------------
 -ASP.NET Web Pages and the Razor syntax provide a fast, approachable, and lightweight way to combine server code with HTML to create dynamic web
  content. Connect to databases, add video, link to social networking sites, and include many more features that help you create beautiful sites
  that conform to the latest web standards.
